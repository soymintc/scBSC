# scBSC (single cell Bivariate Spatial Correlation)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

scBSC allows users calculate bivariate spatial correlation statistics as applied from [Lee S., J Geography Syst (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101090100064) to this wonderful spatial single cell RNA-Seq domain. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of scBSC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scBSC")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("soymintc/scBSC")
```
## Example

The following calculates spatial correlation between expression of two genes, Penk and Cck, from a Seurat-format mouse brain spatial scRNA-seq data from Visium 10x.

#### Using pre-made SeuratData

```R
# Import libraries
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
library(scBSC)

# Import Seurat-format mouse brain data
InstallData("stxBrain")
brain <- LoadData("stxBrain", type = "anterior1")
brain <- SCTransform(brain, assay = "Spatial", verbose = FALSE)

# Calculate bivariate spatial correlation statistics
conn_mat <- make_conn_mat(brain) # creating connectivity matrix; only required once per dataset
bsc <- calc_bsc("Penk", "Cck", brain, conn_mat) # calculate statistics for any pair of genes in the data
print_ <- sprintf("%.3f %.3f %.3f %.3f %.3f",
  bsc$L_XX, # How well is Penk expression spatially clustered
  bsc$L_YY, # How well is Cck expression spatially clustered
  bsc$r_sm, # Correlation between spatially smoothened expression of two genes
  bsc$r, # Correlation between expression of two genes
  bsc$L_XY) # Bivariate spatial correlation (clustering effect & expression correlation)
print(print_) # result: 0.869 0.865 -0.809 -0.729 -0.702
```
#### Using Visium 10x data, imported by Seurat Load10X_Spatial
Of course scBSC also supports your own spatial scRNA-seq, as long as the data is in Seurat spatial object format.

Plotting the relative gene expression between the two genes will show the following result.
Below includes a highly negative, highly positive, and close-to-zero Lxy cases.
```r
# Highly positive spatial correlation example with Lxx 0.869, Lyy 0.864, rsm 0.936, r 0.855, Lxy 0.813
SpatialFeaturePlot(brain, features = c("Gpr88", "Ppp1r1b"), ncol = 2, alpha = c(0.1, 1), max.cutoff = 5)
```
