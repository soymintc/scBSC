# scBSC

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

scBSC help users calculate bivariate spatial correlation statistics as from Lee S. J Geography Syst (2001). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of scBSC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scBSC")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("soymintc/scBSC")
```
## Example

The following calculates spatial correlation between expression of two genes, Gpr88 and Penk, from a Seurat-format mouse brain spatial scRNA-seq data from Visium 10x.

```R
# Import libraries
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
library(dplyr)
library(scBSC)

# Import Seurat-format mouse brain data
InstallData("stxBrain")
brain <- LoadData("stxBrain", type = "anterior1")
brain <- SCTransform(brain, assay = "Spatial", verbose = FALSE)

# Calculate bivariate spatial correlation statistics
conn_mat <- make_conn_mat(brain)
bsc <- calc_bsc("Gpr88", "Penk", brain, conn_mat)
print_line = sprintf("3f\t%.3f\t%.3f\t%.3f\t%.3f",
  bsc$L_XX, # How well is Gpr88 expression spatially clustered
  bsc$L_YY, # How well is Penk expression spatially clustered
  bsc$r_sm, # Correlation between spatially smoothened expression of two genes
  bsc$r, # Correlation between expression of two genes
  bsc$L_XY) # Bivariate spatial correlation (clustering effect + expression correlation)
```
